# Relational Weather Database
## What the Project Does
This project implements a fully normalized relational database that stores daily U.S. weather information collected from National Weather   Service locations. It models a complete geographic hierarchy—State, County, City, Weather Station, and Temperature—allowing users to query   weather patterns by location, date, and temperature values. The database includes a full schema, sample data inserts for all 50 states, and  example SQL queries for analysis.

## Why the Project Is Useful
- Provides a clean, organized way to store weather data for analysis or reporting  
- Ensures data integrity using foreign keys and 3NF design  
- Lets users answer real questions such as:
  - Which states had high temperatures above 70°F?
  - What city a particular weather station belongs to
  - How temperatures vary across different regions  
- Acts as a strong template for any geographic or sensor-based data model

## How Users Can Get Started
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Use the included queries or write your own to explore weather patterns by state, county, city, or station.  
3. Modify or expand the schema if integrating additional weather metrics (humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.).
